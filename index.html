                  Feel free to ask questions, we will probably not have too much
                  time at the end. I might not be able to answer all of them
                  here, but I am around afterwards and will also provide ways to
                  reach out online!

                I got a really cool job at this conference: I am here to show
                you greener pastures
              </p>
              <p>
                About me: First looked into Qt the day some Matthias Ettrich
                posted about doing some desktop environment based on it, but did
                not get involved back then.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was a bit involved during the KDE3/4 transition, but never
                that deeply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Worked on Qt tooling, especially build tools for over a decade.
              </p>

              <p>
                Started to look into rust before pandemic to find out what the
                hype was all about. I moved over eventually. I now work on
                Slint, which I want to show you today.

                I have 40min, so I will not be able to fully introduce Rust or
                Slint. I'll focus on getting you to a state where you can
                experiment yourself instead and point out some things I like
                along the way
              </p>

              <p>
                The big selling point: It's memory safe. So you can not have
                dangling pointers ever... That's extensively covered, so I won't
                :-)
              </p>

              <p>
                Memory safety leads to less issues with concurrency as the rules
                introduced to make the language memory safe also happen to
                prevent data races.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally zero cost abstractions: The language is in the same
                ball-park as C++ with regard to performance and runtime
                overhead.

              <h2>community</h2>
              <p>
                The community is fun to hang out in, friendly and diverse and
                young.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes over-enthusiastic, see RiiR meme. Vut we were the same
                when we were young. Linus just told us to leave his kernel
                alone...
              </p>
              <h2>processes</h2>
              <p>
                Changes are proposed, discussed and implemented in the nightly
                compiler. They are tested there till there is agreement that the
                feature works and brings a benefit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only then the feature gets declared stable and will then be in
                the next stable release (which are 6 weeks apart!).
              </p>
              <p>
                Release testing involves a crater run: A big chunk of the entire
                language eco-system is built and any new build failure gets
                investigated.
              </p>

              <h2>tooling</h2>
              <p>
                I hope you will agree with me when I show how to get your
                experimental environment up!
